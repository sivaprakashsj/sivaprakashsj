### Hi there, This is Sivaprakash S J 👋

I'm a tech entrepreneur and software developer, who believe in tech-driven business. Some technologies I'm currently working on Angular and Android. My interest is to build tech-enabled business platforms to engage business in a more sophisticated way. As CEO & Founder of [Divergent Development Labs](https://d-devlabs.com), I lead my team to work with **"Student & Administration Portal"** 📖 for [Vidyaan](https://vidyaan.d-devlabs.com) - [The Madura College](https://maduracollege.edu.in), **"Video Resume Based Job Portal"** 🏢 for [Job Polish](https://jobpolish.com) - Oplossen Private Limited.

I always dreamed to build connected platforms, I'm fulfilling the dreams by creating **"Aski Vekki"** and **"Bhyaar"**. 

**Aski Vekki** is a service provider lead matching platform and **Bhyaar** is a B2B platform, Both are fully integrated with **business management suite** to give new experience to businesses and it's customers.
